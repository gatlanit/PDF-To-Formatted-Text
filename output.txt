Vocational Expert, and Moises Dach, Hearing Reporter.)

(The hearing commenced at 07:44 AM, on October 14, 2020.)
OPENING STATEMENT BY ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE:

ALJ: This is Administrative Law Judge Rachel Patterson
presiding over the matter at hand, commencing as of 11:00 AM,
Fastern Standard Time on this date, and I would like to take note
that the time displayed on my clock reads 1:00 PM. Claimant Thad
Morar, who is present in person before me today, has an assigned
Social Security number of 658-32-3735. Appearing alongside him 1s
his attorney, Mr. Dillon Lind. As we are convening a live hearing,
I must inform you that both sides will have the opportunity to
present their cases and cross-examine witnesses.

ATTY: = Thank you, pYour™ Honor. I'd like te’ confirm chat my
client's Social Security number is indeed 658-32-3735, and he's
prepared to proceed.

ALJ: T've taken note of Mr. Lind's affirmation regarding
His elient'’s Social Security number being 6598-32-3735. I'm
checking my notes here, and it appears to be accurate. So, just to
confirm, you're saying that your client, Thad Morar, is prepared

to proceed with the hearing as scheduled? And I also want to take

6917

Case ff3d-ce-2efab-1df Document 36-5 Filed 11/30/24 Page 38 of 156

a moment to clarify that we can actually conduct this hearing via
video conference if either of us prefers. It's entirely up to both
parties involved. If Mr. Morar would like to switch to a vwideo
conference format, it wouldn't be an issue at all. We could simply
pause the current proceedings and reset for a remote hearing. Or,
as I mentioned earlier, we can continue on with the in-person
setting that we've already begun. So, Mr. Morar, what would you
DEerer AL Ents) bime?

CLMT: I'd prefer to continue with the in-person hearing as
we've started.

ALJ: Alright then, let's confirm that Mr. Morar prefers to
continue with the in-person hearing as we've started. So, just to
reiterate, you're okay with proceeding with the live hearing
format and not transitioning to a video conference setting at this
time, is that correct? I want to make sure I understand your
preference clearly. Okay, moving on then. Just for my own records,
I'll take note of that. Now, let's review some other details,
shall we? We do have the resumes of two experts who will be
providing their professional opinions in this case. The vocational
expert, Domingo Kuhlman, has a very impressive background and
Qualifications. And then there's also Dr. Shyann Mayer from the
medical field, whose expertise will be invaluable to our
duscussicon today. 1 Wank to make sure that ali ‘relevant
information is available for review before we proceed further. Mr.

Lind, is there anything else you'd like to collect or gather

6918

Case ff3d-ce-2efab-1df Document 36-5 Filed 11/30/24 Page 39 of 156

before our next scheduled meeting date of March 15th, just to
confirm? Any additional documentation or testimony that might be
necessary for a thorough evaluation?

ATTY: Yes, Your Honor, I believe we're good to proceed with
what's already been gathered. Our records are fully developed, and
I'm confident that all necessary documentation has been submitted.
My client and I have reviewed the resumes of both Dr. Mayer and
Mr. Kuhlman, and we're prepared for their testimony on March 15th.
We don't foresee any additional evidence or testimony being needed
EO) SUPPOrE Our Case. I%d Jake Ea confirm with my Client thats hers
also in agreement on this matter.

Ald: I‘*ve taken note of Mr. Lind's confirmation regarding
the adequacy of the gathered evidence and his confidence in the
preparedness for the upcoming testimony on March 15th. I'll make a
notation that both Dr. Mayer and Mr. Kuhlman have been reviewed,
and no further evidence or testimony is expected from either side.
I'm pleased to hear that we're on track with our progress. With
that settled, i'd dake to formally admit all exhibits labeled as
l& down to Exhibit. 12C into the record of this hearing. This
includes any accompanying documentation, photographs, and expert
opinions presented by both parties, as well as the previously
submitted resumes of Dr. Mayer and Mr. Kuhlman. Is there anything
else we need to cover before moving forward with today's
proceedings?

(Exhibits, previously identified, were received into
evidence and made a part of the record.)

ALJ: Now, as we proceed with today's hearing, I'd like to
take a moment to review the various exhibits that have been
submitted for Gaonsideration. Specvtreally, I'm. reterring to
Exhibit number 7B, which appears to be a medical document related
to my claent’s claim. However, “upon ‘closer inspection, “i ve
noticed an inconsistency in the record regarding this particular
exhibit. It seems that there may have been some confusion or
discrepancy in the labeling of certain dates and information
contained within the document itself. I want to ensure that we're
working with accurate and reliable evidence throughout our
discussion teday. So, tf 1 might ask, Mr. Lind, could you! please
clarify or provide further explanation regarding this apparent
inconsistency? Perhaps there waS an error on my part, or maybe
there's some additional context that would help clear up this
discrepancy. I just want to make sure we're on the same page and
have a complete understanding of the information presented in
Exhibit 7B. If I'm not mistaken, is it possible that the dates
mentioned in the exhibit may be... uh, not exactly as they appear?
Or perhaps there's another explanation entirely for this seeming
discrepancy. I just want to ensure we're being thorough and
precise with our evaluation here today.

ATTY: Yes, Your Honor, I Gan clarify the matter regarding
Exhibit 7B. Upon reviewing the document, I agree with you that
there appears to be an inconsistency in the labeling of certain

dates. Specifically, it seems that the dates listed within the

6920

Case ffi3d-ce-2efab-1df Document 36-5 Filed 11/30/24 Page 41 of 156
7

exhibit actually refer to a different set of medical records
altogether, rather than the ones directly related to my client's
claim. To correct this and ensure accuracy, I suggest amending
Exhibit 7B to reflect the correct dates and corresponding medical
Intermation relevant to Mr. Morar's case. This would involve
replacing the current ‘document with a revised version that
accurately reflects the evidence we wish to present. I believe
this can be easily accomplished by substituting the original
exhibit with an updated one, which I've prepared for this purpose.
The new Exhibit 7B should include the correct dates and related
medical documentation specific to Mr. Morar's claim.

ALJ: I"ve taken note of Mr. Lind"s clarification regarding
Exhibit 7B, and I appreciate his diligence in correcting the
discrepancy. To confirm, you're suggesting that we substitute the
current Exhibit 7B with an updated version that accurately
reflects the relevant medical information related to my client's
claim. I understand that this revised exhibit would rectify the
inconsistency in the original document. Before proceeding, I'd
like to address Mr. Morar directly and ensure he's aware of this
proposed amendment. Mr. Morar, are you aware that there may be
potential consequences if we proceed with amending Exhibit 7B?
Even if the decision ultimately favors your claim, an amended
exhibit could impact future claims or appeals, as it would alter
the record. Are you aware of these potential implications and do

you wish to proceed with the amendment?

6921

CLMT : Yes, I understand. Please go ahead with amending
Pxzhiott IB.
ALJ: I understand from Mr. Lind's explanation that we're

proposing to substitute Exhibit 7B with a revised version that
accurately reflects the relevant medical information related to my
clvent’s claim. Live also taken mote of the Cillaimant's
confirmation that he understands the potential implications of
amending this exhibit and is consenting to proceed with the
amendment. With that established, I'd like to direct your
attention to our hearing reporter, Moises Dach. Please make a
notation in the record regarding the proposed amendment to Exhibit
7B, indicating that we are substituting it with an updated version
reflecting the correct dates and medical information relevant to
Mr. Morar’s claim.

to ensure comprehensive care, and maintaining accurate records of
patient treatments and outcomes.

Q Have you ever worked for or been affiliated with the

A Wo, I have never worked for or been affiliated with the
Social Security Administration in any capacity.

Q Alright then, let's confirm that you've never worked for
or been affiliated with the Social Security Administration in any
capacity. Yes, we have it on record. You said no, and I want to
make sure we're clear on this point. So, just to reiterate, you've
never worked for the SSA, and there's no connection between you
And the SSA at all. Now, let's move on to the réason why you
believe you are disabled. Can you please explain in your own words
why you think you qualify for disability benefits under Social
Security?

& Yes, Your Honor, as I was trying to Say betore, 1 believe
I qualify for disability benefits under Social Security because of
my Peripheral Neuropathy condition. You see, this condition has
been causing me a great deal of pain and discomfort, specifically
with the numbness and tingling sensations in my hands and feet.
It's like my body is just shutting down on me, and it's very hard
to describe, but it’s just constant, you know? And even though
I've tried various treatments and therapies, nothing seems to be
working, and I'm just getting worse and worse. I mean, I've had to

stop doing a lot of the things that I used to enjoy, like playing

I]

goles Ory hiking with my tamily, because I just can't handle 1t
anymore. My doctor has “cold me” that 2 have severe Perapheral
Neuropathy, and he's recommended that I not work anymore because
it would be too strenuous for my condition. So, in my opinion, I'm
clearly disabled and need to receive these benefits so I can take
care of myself and get the medical attention I need.

O I understand your concerns about your Peripheral
Neuropathy condition and how it's affecting your daily life, Mr.
Morar. You're saying that you've experienced numbness and tingling
sensations in your hands and feet, which is making it difficult
for you to perform even simple tasks. I can see why this would be
a tremendous burden on you. And I want to commend you for being
proactive about seeking medical attention and trying various
treatments. However, it seems like nothing has been effective so
far, Which iS concerning. You're saying that your doetor has
recommended that you not work anymore because of the severity of
your condition, which is something we take very seriously here at
the SSA. I want to make sure that I understand this correctly: you
believe that your Peripheral Neuropathy has rendered you unable to
perform any gainful employment, and therefore, you qualify for
Gisability benefits under Social Security? Youre absolutely
right, —Mr. Morar, “1 affirm that your statement is clear and
straightforward. Now, I'd like to delve a bit deeper into this
condition of yours. Can you tell me more about what's been going

on with the numbness and tingling sensations in your hands and

6925

Case ff3d-ce-2efab-1df Document 36-5 Filed 11/30/24 Page 46 of 156
12
feet? Is it constant, or does it come and go? And have you noticed
any other symptoms that might be related to your Peripheral
Neuropathy?

A Yes, YOur Honor, as T*ve heen saying “all along, my
Peripheral Neuropathy condition is just really getting the best of
me. It's like this constant, nagging feeling in my hands and feet
that won't go away. And it's not just numbness and tingling,
although those are definitely there too. No, sir, it's more than
that. I mean, sometimes it feels like my hands and feet are on
fire, but not in a good way, if you know what I mean. It's thie
burning sensation that just won't quit, and it's really getting to
the point where I'm having trouble sleeping at night because of
it. And don't even get me started on the weakness thing, Your
Honor. Yeah, I'd say I've lost some strength in my hands and feet
over time, which is making everyday tasks a real challenge for me.
I Mean, trying €6 open jars or hold onto things can be 4 real
struggle when you're as weak as I am right now. But, like I said
Derore, it’s nok Just about the Symptoms themselves, it's how
they're affecting my daily life and making it hard for me to do
even simple things. And I know what you're thinking, 'Mr. Morar,
have you tried this or Ehat?” And yeah, Your Honor, I've tried a
whole bunch of treatments and therapies, but like I said before,
nothing seems to be working. I mean, it's not that the doctors
aAben = Urying Or anything, 2i*S just that my condition is so

severe that they're having trouble finding something that'11

6926

Case ff3d-ce-2efab-1df Document 36-5 Filed 11/30/24 Page 47 of 156
13
actually help me. So, yeah, that's where I'm at right now, Your
Honor.

ALd: tT affirm, Mr. Mofar, that 1 understand your Peripheral
Neuropathy condition to be a severe and debilitating disorder that
affects not just your physical abilities but also your daily life
and overall well= being. Your déscription of the numbness,
tingling, burning sensations, and weakness in your hands and feet
is quite vivid, and it's clear that these symptoms are having a
profound impact on your ability to function and participate in
Setrvities, £ mist Say, I'm particularly cencerned abou. Che
reports of burning sensations and the significant weakness you've
experienced in your hands and feet, which would likely preclude
even simple tasks like opening jars or holding onto objects. Based
on what you've shared with me, it appears that your Peripheral
Neuropathy has indeed rendered you unable to engage in any
substantial gainful activity for a period of at least lz months,
which is a key criterion for eligibility under our Social Security
disability program. I'm going to need something from the attorney
to confirm whether there are any other medical records or
documentation that can Support your claim and substantiate the
severity of this condition. Attorney, would you be so kind as to
provide me with those records, please? Specititally, Lies like to
see any recent EMG or nerve conduction studies that might shed
more light on the extent of Mr. Morar's Peripheral Neuropathy and

Tessinpact on His motor function.

6927

ATTY: tes, Your Honor. I'll provide those records to you
immediately. In fact, I have them right here in my files. Let me
just pull them out real quick.

ALJ: Thank you, Attorney. Please proceed with providing
those records to me. In the meantime, Mr. Morar, I'd like to delve
a bit deeper into one of your symptoms that caught my attention:
the burning sensations in your hands and feet. You described it as
feeling jlike they're on fire” but not in a@ good way. Can you tell
me more about what that experience is like for you? For instance,
do these sensations occur constantly or are they episodic? And can
you aescribe their intensity level - would you say it's a 2 out of
10, or is it more severe?

BY ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE:

A fo be honest with you, “Your Honor, those burning
sensations are a constant companion for me now. They're not just
occasional episodes; they're there all the time, simmering just
below the surface. And as for their intensity level, I'd say it"s
more like an 8 or 9 out of 10 every day. Sometimes it feels like
my skin 1S being set on fire, and it's a deep, searing pain that
just won't quit. It's like nothing I've ever experienced before,
and it's getting to the point where I'm starting to lose hope that
anything will ever alleviate this suffering.

@) I understand, Mr. Morar, that these burning sensations
are a constant and intense presence in your life, affecting you

daily at am extremely high level of severity. I want to

6928

Case ff3d-ce-2efab-1df Document 36-5 Filed 11/30/24 Page 49 of 156
15
acknowledge the profound impact this is having on your well-being
and quality of life. Given the severity of these symptoms, I'd
like to ask: Did you ever consult with any doctor or specialist
about these burning sensations, specifically seeking a medical
evaluation or treatment plan to address this issue?

A 16s,  £ Saw a neurologist whe specialized an pain
management. He performed some tests and prescribed me some
medication to try and control the pain.

QO [6*s noted in your file, Mr. Morar, that you were
referred to a neurologist who specializes in pain management. This
doctor performed tests and prescribed medication to help alleviate
the burning sensations in your hands and feet. Can you tell me,
approximately how often do these episodes of intense burning
occur? Would it be fair to say they happen daily, or are there
periods where they subside somewhat?

A To be honest, Your Honor, these episodes of intense
burning occur pretty much every single day now. I'd say it"s
around 20 to 25 times a day, sometimes more if I'm under stress or
haven't been taking my medication as prescribed. It's like my body
is just constantly sending out these signals that something's
wrong, and it can be really overwhelming at times.

QO I understand, Mr. Morar, that intense burning sensations
occur approximately 20-25 times a day, exacerbated by stress or
non-adherence to medication.

A Yes, ‘our Honor, 1e"s Like ty skin is constantly

6929

Case fi3d-ce-2efab-1df Document 36-5 Filed 11/30/24 Page 50 of 156
16

screaming at me, and I just feel like I'm at my wit's end most of
Che time. ff got so bad that even simple tasks like taking a
shower became an ordeal because the water would trigger these
intense burning sensations in my hands and feet. I had to get
someone to help me with even basic hygiene, which was really tough
for Mey “GO Saccept,” but © just “didn't” have the strength Gr
coordination to do it on my own anymore.

@) I understand that intense burning sensations from
Peripheral Neuropathy are causing you significant distress and
impairment in daily activities.

A It got to the point where I couldn't even take care of
myself, Your Honor. Simple things like eating or getting dressed
became monumental tasks because my hands and feet would start
burning intensely just from doing those everyday activities. It
was like my body was rebelling against me, refusing to cooperate
With anything I tried to do, The pain and discomfort were se
intense that I'd have to stop what I was doing, sit down, and just
try to catch my breath. Sometimes it took hours for the burning
sensations to subside enough for me to continue with my day.

@) I understand that your Peripheral Neuropathy symptoms
have progressed to the point where daily activities are severely
impaired, requiring frequent breaks for pain management.

A. One thing I’ve had to give up entirely, Your Honor, is
being able to drive a car. The constant burning sensations in my

hands and feet make it impossible for me to safely operate a

6930

Case ff3d-ce-2efab-1df Document 36-5 Filed 11/30/24 Page 51 of 156
17
vehicle, even with adaptive equipment or modifications. It's
something that most people take for granted, but for me, it's
become a luxury I can no longer afford.

QO You're unable to drive due to burning sensations in your
hands and feet.

A Another thing I've had to give up, Your Honor, is being
able to play music. I used to be a musician and loved playing the
Guitar, but now the burning sensations in my fingers make it
impossible for me to press the strings down or even hold the
instrument without causing more pain. It's not just about losing a
hobby, it's about feeling like I've lost myself because music was
such a big part of who I am.

O Is this consistent with your records from 2022?

A Yes.

Q You were taking Zorvax for your pain management in
January 2022. Can you confirm?

A According to my medical records from January 2022, I was
indeed taking Zorvax as part of my pain management regimen for my
Peripheral Neuropathy symptoms.

QO. You aleo Eook lyripta in 2022. eHow did It aftect™ your
burning sensation symptoms?

A Yes, I was taking Lyripta in addition to zorvax, and
while it did provide some relief from my burning sensations, the
effects were not long-lasting. I'd experience a brief reduction in

symptoms, but they would often return with equal intensity once

6931

Case ff3d-ce-2efab-1df Document 36-5 Filed 11/30/24 Page 52 of 156
18
the medication wore off.

Q According to your records, you stopped taking Zorvax in
May 2022, yet you mentioned taking it again in January 2023. Can
you clarify why there's a discrepancy in this information?

A I had a period where I was unable to afford Zorvax, so I
had to stop taking it in May 2022. However, when my financial
situation improved, I resumed taking it again.

ATTY: Your Honor, may I clarify something regarding the
discontinuation of Zorvax? My client was actually on a temporary
discount program through his pharmacy provider during that period
and had mistakenly indicated he stopped taking it due to
affordability issues when in fact he continued to receive
discounted medication. He resumed regular prescription costs once
the discount program ended.

ALJ: It's clarified that Mr. Morar continued taking Zorvax,
albeit at a discounted rate through a pharmacy program. He resumed
regular prescription costs once the discount program ended in May
2022,

BY ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE:

A That"*s Correct, Your Honor. 1 contanued takang Zorvax
through the discount program, but resumed regular costs when it
ended in May 2022.

O Let's move on to the Vocational Expert's report, dated
March 2023. I'd like to review the findings and potential impact

eon Mr. Morar”’s ability Eo werk.

6932

Case ff3d-ce-2efab-1df Document 36-5 Filed 11/30/24 Page 53 of 156
19

A I've been unable to secure any employment since my
symptoms worsened in early 2022 due to difficulty performing daily
tasks, let alone working a full-time job.

QO According to your testimony, you've been unable to work
since early 202? due to difficulty performing daily tasks. Id
like to review the Vocational Expert's report and understand how
it aligns with your statements. One aspect that caught my
attention was the mention of a new symptom - are you experiencing
any significant changes in bladder control or urinary function?

CLMT: Yes, I've started experiencing some issues with
bladder control, which is adding another layer of complexity to my
daily life.

BY ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE:

A You've mentioned experiencing issues with bladder control
as an added symptom, which has further impacted your daily life.
Prior to these recent difficulties, did you have any previous
treatments or conditions related to urinary function?

Q I had a kidney stone in 2019 and it caused temporary pain
and some issues with urination for a short period after.

A That's noted regarding your 2019 kidney stone. Next, I'd
like to clarify your current. level of residual «functional
capacity.

0 My RFD is significantly impacted by my Peripheral
Neuropathy symptoms, but I can still perform simple tasks

unrelated to my primary conditions, like laundry and meal prep.

6933

Case ff3d-ce-2efab-1df Document 36-5 Filed 11/30/24 Page 54 of 156
20

A You stated earlier that driving became impossible due to
your Peripheral Neuropathy symptoms, specifically the intense
burning sensations in your hands and feet. Can you explain how
your residual functional capacity for tasks like laundry and meal
prep does not appear to be significantly impacted by these same
symptoms, given their severity?

Q I understand what you're getting at, Your Honor. While my
Peripheral Neuropathy symptoms do affect most of my daily
activities, I can still manage simple tasks like laundry and meal
prep because they don"t require the fine motor skills of
concentration that driving does. However, even these tasks are
made extremely difficult for me due to the intense burning
sensations in my hands and feet, which makes it hard to perform
even basic actions without significant discomfort and fatigue.

A You can still do simple tasks like laundry and meal prep
due to their lower physical demands compared to driving. However,
even these tasks are extremely difficult for you.

O “Every task gis a struggle, Your Honors: Im constantly
managing pain and discomfort throughout my day, even with simple
tasks like laundry and meal prep. It's exhausting and takes an
emotional toll.

A You're saying that even simple tasks are extremely
GEtTii cule efor you due Eo Constant pain and discomfort. Can these
tasks be performed with reasonable persistence or dedication?

Q No.

6934

Case ff3d-ce-2efab-1df Document 36-5 Filed 11/30/24 Page 55 of 156
21

A You've stated your inability to perform simple tasks with
reasonable persistence or dedication. What is your current level
of functionality considering these limitations?

©O I'm unable to perform even simple tasks, Your Honor. I'd
also like to discuss the impact of my weight loss on my overall
health since developing Peripheral Neuropathy.

A You've mentioned your weight loss since developing
Peripheral Neuropathy. Can you provide more information about
this? I'd like to understand its impact on your overall health and
how it relates to your current level of functionality.

O Since developing Peripheral Neuropathy, I've experienced
Significant weight loss due to decreased appetite and food intake
caused by chronic pain and discomfort. This has led to a decrease
in my overall energy levels and has made it even more challenging
for me to perform daily tasks. My healthcare provider has noted
that my weight loss is likely exacerbating my Peripheral
Neuropathy symptoms, creating a vicious cycle of worsening health
and decreasing functionality.

A Acknowledged. Have you experienced any notable
improvements in your symptoms or functionality with any specific
treatments or therapies?

O I've found some relief from Lyripta injections, but it's
been inconsistent and doesn't last long.

A Inconsistent relief with Lyripta injections is not

sustainable for daily life. How do you manage your chronic pain

now?

@ Currentiy, I Manage my chronic pain ehrough regular
Zorvax medication, as well as various coping mechanisms such as
meditation and deep breathing exercises to help alleviate some of
the discomfort. However, these efforts are not enough to make a
Significant difference in my overall quality of life. In addition
to managing my Peripheral Neuropathy symptoms, I've also been
dealing with increasing numbness and tingling sensations in my
face, which has made it difficult for me to speak clearly and eat
certain foods without experiencing discomfort.

A I understand that you're still managing your chronic pain
with Zorvax medication and coping mechanisms like meditation and
deep breathing exercises. I'd like to go back to the Vocational
Expert's report for a moment, which suggested that there might be
some transferable skills from your previous work experience that
could be applied in a more accommodated work setting. Can you tell
me more about what kind of accommodations or modifications would
need to be made for you to perform even simple tasks?

QO I'd need a quiet, comfortable workspace with minimal
distractions, frequent breaks for pain management, and assistance
with tasks that require fine motor skills or concentration.

ALJ: Acknowledged. Counselor, do you have any questions for
the claimant?

RAAMINATION OF MEDICAL EXPERT BY ATTORNEY:

OQ Your Honor, isn't Mr. Morar's inability to secure even
unskilled sedentary work due in part to his chronic pain and
fatigue, not just physical demands of the job?

Ay Yes; Eheat'’s correct.

QO Given Mr. Morar's inability to secure unskilled sedentary
work due to chronic pain and fatigue, does his residual functional
Capacity gualifty him for disability benefits under the SSA
guidelines?

A Yes, I believe my residual functional capacity and
inability to secure even unskilled sedentary work due to chronic
pain and fatigue qualify me for disability benefits under the SSA
guidelines, taking into account my overall medical condition,
daily living @etivities, and the impact of my Peripheral
Neuropathy symptoms on my ability to perform basic tasks,

AS Yss..

QO Your Honor, given Mr. Morar'’s complete reliance on
Lyripta injections for pain management, doesn't this indicate an
inability to function without these treatments ¢

A. Yes, Your Honor, the fact that I'm completely reliant on
Lyripta injections to Manage my chronic pain indicates an
inability to funetion without these treatments, which further
supports my claim for disability benefits.

@) Considering Mr. Morar's complete reliance on lLyripta
injections and his inability to secure even unskilled sedentary
work due to chronic pain and fatigue, doesn't this constitute an
inability to engage in substantial gainful activity?

A Yes.

QO Given Mr. Morar's reliance on Lyripta injections for pain
management, isn't it true that he would likely be unable to
maintain even a sedentary job?

A Yes.

QO Given Mr. Morar's complete reliance on Lyripta injections
for pain management, isn't his ability to engage in substantial
gainful activity severely impaired?

A Yes.

e Your Honor, I'd like to reiterate that Mr. Morar's
complete and utter reliance on Lyripta injections for pain
Management: 1s @ critical factor in “his inability to engage in

substantial gainful activity. And isn’t 1t also true, Your Honor,

that without these treatments, he would be unable to function at
all? And wouldn"t that mean, therefore, that he is indeed
completely disabled, and thus eligible for disability benefits
under the SSA guidelines?

Ay Yes:

Q Without Lyripta injections, Mr. Morar would be bedridden.
Is his disability deemed permanent?

A Yes.

O Mr. Morar*s Condition will not improve: Has he reached
maximum medical improvement?

A Yes.

Q His condition won't improve, so shouldn't his benefits be
retroactive to when he stopped working due to Peripheral
Neuropathy symptoms?

A Yes.

Q Mr. Morar's medical records indicate that his Peripheral
Neuropathy symptoms rendered him unable to work since January
Z018, correct?

A Yes.

@) Since January 2OUEB, Mr. Morar's cond tien has

ATTY: I'm done with my line of questioning, Your Honor.

ALJ: Attorney, I'd like to request clarification on a few
points you raised during your questioning. Firstly, regarding Mr.
Morar's reliance on Lyripta injections for pain management, could
you please elaborate on how this specifically impacts his ability
to engage in substantial gainful activity? While it's clear that
the treatments are crucial for his pain management, I'd like a
more detailed explanation of how this translates to an inability
to perform even sedentary work tasks.

ATTY: Lyripta injections are administered every two weeks,
creating a treatment cycle that leaves Mr. Morar in excruciating
pain during the interims. This renders him unable to concentrate,
causing errors and decreased productivity. His ability to maintain
even sedentary work tasks is severely compromised by the absence
o£ treatments.

ALJ: Are you saying that even with Lyripta injections, Mr.
Morar still suffers from significant pain, affecting his ability
to work? And are you claiming that he wouldn't be able to maintain
any job without these treatments?

ATTY: Yes, Your Honor. Even with Lyripta injections, Mr.
Morar experiences debilitating pain. Without them, he wouldn't be
able to maintain any job.

ALJ: Are his Lyripta injections effective in controlling

Pain during treatment periods?

of your experiences with Peripheral Neuropathy. I appreciate the
time you've taken to share this information with me. As we move
forward in this process, it's essential that we consider all
relevant factors and perspectives. To aid in our evaluation, I'd
like to introduce Dr. Shyann Mayer, a renowned expert in the field
of neurology. His extensive background and qualifications are
impressive, as you can see from his resume, which is available fax
review upon request. Dr. Mayer has over 15 years of experience in
treating patients with complex nerve disorders, including

Peripheral Neuropathy. He's published numerous papers on the

subject and has presented at various conferences. You can view his
full resume by visiting our website or contacting my office
airectly." With that said, I*d dike so ask Lhe Counsel 1t you nave
any objections to Dr. Mayer serving as our medical expert in this
case?

ATTY: Woe objection.

(The medical expert, THAD MORAR, MD, having been first duly
sworn, testified as follows:)

EXAMINATION OF MEDICAL EXPERT BY ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE:

Q Dr. Shyann Mayer, for the record, can you please confirm
your full name?

A Shyann Marlowe Mayer.

@ Dr. Mayer, can you briefly summarize your medical
education and experience with Peripheral Neuropathy?

A Wh, wes, of ‘cctirse, Your Honor. so, 1 euppose [ should
start from the very beginning, way back in medical school, where I
earned my Doctor of Medicine degree from Harvard Medical School,
which, as you may know, Le ‘one oF the Mest presiagilous
institutions for medical education in the world. And then, after
completing my residency program in neurology at Massachusetts
General Hospital, I went on to become a board-certified expert in
the field of neurology, with a special focus on treating patients
with complex nerve disorders, including Peripheral Neuropathy,
which is, as you're aware, a condition that affects the peripheral

nerves, and can cause Symptoms such as pain, numbness, and

6943

Case ff3d-ce-2efab-1df Document 36-5 Filed 11/30/24 Page 64 of 156
30

tingling in the hands and feet. Now, over the course of my 15-year
career, I've had the privilege of treating numerous patients with
this condition, and I've also published several papers on the
subject, including a notable study on the use of intravenous
immunoglobulin for treating chronic inflammatory demyelinating
polyneuropathy, which is just one type of Peripheral Neuropathy.
And, if I may add, I've also presented at various conferences,
including the annual meeting of the American Academy of Neurology,
where I've shared my expertise with colleagues from all over the
world.

© Dr. Mayer, are you specifically familiar with treating
patients who have symptoms of pain, numbness, and tingling in
their hands and feet due to Peripheral Neuropathy?

A Yes.

OQ Have you reviewed this case?

ye Yes.

O Is there any evidence that would contradict Mr. Morar's
disability claim?

A Well, if I may say so, Your Honor, upon reviewing the
case file and medical records provided, it appears that Mr. Morar
has been treated by multiple physicians over the years for his
Peripheral Neuropathy symptoms. However, one thing that caught my
attention was that, according to the medical records, there were a
few instances where Mr. Morar reported experiencing some degree of

pain relief and improvement in his numbness and tingling symptoms

6944

Case ff3d-ce-2efab-1df Document 36-5 Filed 11/30/24 Page 65 of 156
31

after undergoing physical therapy sessions. Now, I know what
you're thinking, Your Honor, but please bear with me. While these
improvements may not be significant enough to completely alleviate
his symptoms, they do suggest that Mr. Morar's condition is not
entirely static or unresponsive to treatment. And if I might add,
the fact that he was able to perform certain activities, such as
walking and even engaging in light exercise, suggests that his
condition may not be as severe as he claims it to be. Now, I'm not
saying this necessarily contradicts his disability claim, but
rather it raises some questions about the extent of his
Limteations, if you’ will.

QO Poss His contradict Mr. Morar’s “claim that he, 2s
completely incapacitated?

A Well, df I miqht reiterate, Your Honor, upom further
review of Mr. Morar's medical records and treatment history, it
appears that there were instances where he reported experiencing
some degree of pain relief and improvement in his numbness and
tingling symptoms after undergoing physical therapy sessions. And,
if I may add, these improvements were significant enough to allow
him to perform certain activities, such as walking and even
engaging in light exercise. Now, considering this, it does seem
that Mr. Morar's claim of being completely incapacitated might be
somewhat inconsistent with the evidence presented. I mean, if he
was able to experience some degree of improvement through physical

therapy, wouldn't it Stand to reason that he could potentially

6945

Case ff3d-ce-2efab-1df Document 36-5 Filed 11/30/24 Page 66 of 156
32

benefit from further treatment or interventions aimed at improving
his functional capacity? For instance, couldn”: he have been
referred to a pain management specialist for further evaluation
and possible treatment options? Or perhaps he could have engaged
in more aggressive physical therapy sessions, tailored to address
specific needs and goals? It's not about saying that Mr. Morar is
capable of doing everything on his own or without any limitations,
no, no, but rather it seems to suggest that his condition may be
somewhat more manageable than initially claimed. And if I might
add, Your Honor, in my expert opinion, a multidisciplinary
approach involving physical therapy, occupational therapy, and
possibly even some pharmacological interventions could have
potentially helped Mr. Morar achieve a better quality of life, you
know, something that would allow him to engage in daily activities
with greater ease and comfort.

QO You're saying Mr. Morar’s claim eof being completely
incapacitated may be inconsistent with the evidence?

ATTY: G@byectton, Your sHenor. | DE. . Mayer ~eeems tO - ie
suggesting that Mr. Morar's condition is not as severe as claimed,
based on a couple of instances where he reported experiencing pain
relief and improvement in Symptoms after physical therapy
sessions. However, this does not necessarily mean that Mr. Morar
is capable of performing all daily activities without any
limitations or that his condition is entirely manageable.

Furthermore, the fact that Mr. Morar required treatment for his

6946

Case ff3d-ce-2efab-1df Document 36-5 Filed 11/30/24 Page 67 of 156
33
Peripheral Neuropathy symptoms suggests that it was indeed a
significant issue. I'd like to request that Dr. Mayer clarify this
point further and provide more context regarding the extent of Mr.
Morar's functional capacity.

Aud: Des, Mayer, clarify: Does Mr. Morar*®s condition allow
for any level of functional capacity?

ATTY: Dr. Mayer, I'm Counsel representing Claimant. In
response to the ALJ's question, can you confirm whether Mr.
Morar's condition allows for any level of functional capacity?

ME | Peau

ATTY: Dr, Mayer, isn't it true that any functional capacity
Mr. Morar may have is severely limited to only short periods of
sedentary activity, rendering him effectively unemployable in the
competitive job market?

MES esc

ATTY: Dr. Mayer, if I may rephrase your previous answer,
you're Saying that’ Mr. Morar"s condition severely restricts his
ability to engage in any substantial amount of work or activity on
a consistent basis? In other words, even short periods of
sedentary activity are often followed by significant worsening of
symptoms, making it nearly impossible for him to maintain
employment?

ME: wes.

ATTY: De. Mayer, wouldn’& you agree that Mr. Morar’s

condition is characterized by chronic and debilitating pain,

6947

Case ff3d-ce-2efab-1df Document 36-5 Filed 11/30/24 Page 68 of 156
34
rendering him unable to perform even simple daily activities
without significant exacerbation of symptoms?

ME: Yes, I would agree with that assessment, Counsel. Mr.
Morar's condition does indeed present a complex challenge in terms
of managing his pain and maintaining functional capacity, given
the chronic nature of his Peripheral Neuropathy symptoms.

ALT: Dr. Mayer, I'd like to reiterate that Mr. Morar’™s
Condition as nol  7Wust about physical symptoms, bw “also the
emotional toll it takes on him. He experiences anxiety and
depression due to the uncertainty of his condition and the impact
it has on his daily life. Doesn't this complexity further support
our contention that he is indeed disabled and unable to engage in
substantial gainful activity? And wouldn't you agree that any
attempts to downplay or minimize the severity of his symptoms are
simply not supported by the evidence?

Mey Yes.

ATTY: Deu Mayer, Iec twke to goa back to Wour previous
testimony about Mr. Morar's condition allowing for some level of
functional capacity, and yet you also stated that it's severely
limited to only short periods of sedentary activity. Can you
clarify what exactly you mean by "short. periods"? Is it a matter
of minutes, hours, or perhaps just fleeting moments where he can
manage to engage in some sort of activity before needing to rest?
And doesn't this inherent variability and unpredictability of his

condition serve as yet another reminder that Mr. Morar is truly

6948

Case ff3d-ce-2efab-1df Document 36-5 Filed 11/30/24 Page 69 of 156
35
unable to perform even the most basic tasks on a consistent basis?

ME: By ‘short perzeds', | mean hours, met manutes or
fleeting moments.

ATTY: So, Dr. Mayer, I want to make Sure I understand this
correctly. You're saying that Mr. Morar can engage in some sort of
activity for hours at a time, but then he needs to rest? But isn't
that just another way of saying that he's only able to do things
intermittently, and not consistently on an hourly basis? I mean,
if he can only work for a few hours before needing to take a
break, doesn't that really mean he's unable to sustain any kind of
regular employment or daily activity? And isn't it true that this
sort of fluctuating level of functionality is actually a hallmark
of Peripheral Neuropathy, making it even more challenging for
individuals like Mr. Morar to cope with their condition? I mean,
can you really expect someone in his shoes to be able to function
normally on any given day when they're constantly struggling with
these kinds of unpredictable symptoms?

ME : That's correct, Counsel. The fluctuating level of
functionality is indeed a common challenge faced by individuals
with Peripheral Neuropathy, including Mr. Morar. While he may be
able to engage in some activities for short periods, his symptoms
often require him to take breaks and adjust his daily routines
accordingly. As you've aptly put it, this intermittent pattern of
functioning makes it extremely difficult for someone like Mr.

Morar to maintain a regular employment or daily activity schedule,

6949

Case ff3d-ce-2efab-1df Document 36-5 Filed 11/30/24 Page 70 of 156
36
given the unpredictability of his condition.
ATTY: I have no further questions, Your Honor.

BY ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE:

QO Dr. Mayer, can you take a look at Exhibit A and tell me
how Mr. Morar's condition is affected by his recent change in
medication?

A Yes, Your Honor. Aiter reviewing Exhibit A, I can ses
that Mr. Morar recently switched to a new medication regimen for
his Peripheral Neuropathy symptoms. From my examination of the
medical records, it appears that this change in medication has
resulted in some improvement in his pain management and overall
LUnCEOnNaL ‘Capacity. . However, 2 must note that this ais a
relatively recent development, and there are still significant
fluctuations in Mr. Morar's condition that make it challenging for
him to engage in sustained daily activities or employment.

@) Can you explain, Dr. Mayer, how Mr. Morar's recent
increase in physical therapy sessions, as noted on page 3 of
Exhibit B, affects his overall ability to perform daily activities
and work-related tasks?

A The increased physical therapy sessions have helped
manage Mr. Morar's symptoms, but his condition remains highly
variable and unpredictable. He still experiences significant pain
and numbness that impacts his ability to perform daily activities
and work-related tasks.

O Can you review Exhibit C, which shows Mr. Morar's medical

6950

Case ff3d-ce-2efab-1df Document 36-5 Filed 11/30/24 Page 71 of 156
37
history and treatment plan, and explain how his current condition
compares to what is described in the treatment notes from 2018?

A Upon reviewing Exhibit C, I can see that Mr. Morar's
current condition is more severe than what was described in the
treatment notes from 2018. His symptoms have worsened over time,
with increased pain and numbness affecting his daily activities
and work-related tasks.

O het"s take a look at Exhibit DBD, which shows the results
of Mz... Morar"s cognitive funeticn tests from his Tecent
evaluation. Can you tell me, Dr. Mayer, how these test results
rélate to your overall, assessment of Mr. Morar's ability to
perform work-related tasks and daily activities?

A The EeSE results indicate cognitive impairments
consistent with Mr. Morar's reported symptoms and limitations.

ATTY: I'd like to interject, Your Honor. Based on Dr.
Mayer's testimony regarding the fluctuating nature of Mr. Morar's
symptoms, the impact of his medication regimen, and the results of
the Cognitive function tests, it's clear that his condition is
still quite severe and debilitating. I'd argue that these facts,
combined with the overall evidence presented in this case, further
Support our contention that Mr. Morar is indeed disabled and
unable to engage in substantial gainful activity.

QO Mr. Kuhlman, as a Vocational Expert, can you assess the
Claimant's prior work experience as a Physical Therapist and
GQelermane if it 18 Pransferable to other Jobs in the fastens!
economy?

A Ah, yes, the claitiant's prior work experience as a
Physical Therapist, Your Honor. Well, in my expert opinion, being
a Physical Therapist requires a high level of physical and mental
stamina, not to mention a strong understanding of human anatomy
and biomechanics. I mean, these individuals have to be able to
stand for long periods of time, lift heavy equipment, and move
around with patients, all while maintaining attention to detail
and providing top-notch care. It's truly a demanding job, if you
ask me. Now, in terms of the physical demands, I would categorize
Physical Therapy as a very heavy occupation, requiring prolonged
standing, walking, lifting, carrying, pushing, and pulling, not to
mention frequent bending, stooping, and kneeling. And let's not
forget about the mental demands, Your Honor - these individuals
have to be able to multitask, -prioritize tasks, and make quick
decisions under pressure. So, in terms of its physical and mental
requirements, I would rate Physical Therapy as a 7 on the SVP
scale, which is considered skilled work. And while some Physical
Therapists may spend more time sitting at a desk than others,
especially those working in administrative roles or doing
paperwork, the vast majority of their day is spent on-the-go,

interacting with patients and performing hands- on therapy

6952

Case ff3d-ce-2efab-1df Document 36-5 Filed 11/30/24 Page 73 of 156
39
sessions.

Q Mr. Kuhlman, you've assessed Physical Therapy as a very
heavy occupation, requiring a high level of physical and mental
stamina. Can you take us through your reasoning for why you
categorized it as such? And how does that relate to the claimant's
residual functional capacity?

A I based my assessment on the physical demands of the job,
including prolonged standing, walking, lifting, and bending, as
well as the mental demands, such as multitasking and decision-
making under pressure. Given the claimant's reported symptoms of
chronic pain, Numoness, and fatigue, I believe his residual
functional capacity is significantly limited, precluding even
sedentary work, let alone the physical and mental demands of
Physical Therapy.

OQ Based on Mr. Kuhlman"s assessment, I'd like to restate
the claimant's profile as follows: a male of the claimant's age,
ecqucationm level, and work History, with a residual functional
capacity for sedentary work, but also limited by chronic pain,
numbness, and fatigue, precluding even sedentary work that
requires prolonged standing, walking, lifting, or bending. Now,
Counselor, would this profile be consistent with the claimant's
ability to perform other jobs in the national economy?

A No.

Q Mr. Kuhlman, based on your assessment of the claimant's

residual functional. capacity and vocational profile, I'd like to

6953

Case ff3d-ce-2efab-1df Document 36-5 Filed 11/30/24 Page 74 of 156
40)
ask: does the claimant's chronic pain continue to be a significant
issue in performing even sedentary work, as you mentioned earlier?

A Yes.

ALJ: Thank you, Mr. Kuhlman. Based on your assessment, it
appears that the claimant's chronic pain and other symptoms
Significantly limit his ability to perform even sedentary work.
I'd like to ‘take this opportunity £0 summarize the evidence
presented in this case. The medical records indicate that the
claimant suffers from a severe impairment of his musculoskeletal
system, which @ftiects hire Wbelrry to stand, walk, J2ft, and, bend:
Dr. Mayer's testimony confirmed that the claimant's condition is
chronic and irreversible, and that he has been unable to work
since his. ‘sSsecident’ die’ etc “His.” pain and other Symptons.
Additionally, the vocational expert's assessment found that even
sedentary work would be precluded by the claimant's residual
functional capacity. It appears, therefore, that the claimant
meets the criteria for a finding of disability under the Social
Security Act. I'd like to ask Counselor: do you have any questions
or would you like to provide any additional information?

fe Ded Babs Yes, Your Honor.

EXAMINATION OF VOCATIONAL EXPERT BY ATTORNEY:

OQ Your Honor, regarding the claimant's employability, I'd
like to ask Mr. Kuhlman a follow-up question: wouldn't the fact
that the claimant requires frequent breaks to manage his symptoms

and adjust his daily routines also significantly impact his

6954

Case ff3d-ce-2efab-1df Document 36-5 Filed 11/30/24 Page /5 of 156
4]
ability to perform even sedentary work?

A Yes, Counselor, the claimant"’s need for frequent breaks
to manage his symptoms would indeed significantly impact his
ability to perform even sedentary work, given the demands of a
typical workday and the potential consequences of missed
productivity or attendance due to chronic pain.

QO Thank you, Mr. Kuhlman.» Your Honor, 2"d like to “ask
another question regarding the claimant's employability: wouldn't
his chronic numbness in his extremities also impact his ability to
perform even sedentary work, given the need for fine motor skills
and hand dexterity that many jobs require?

BR Yes, Counselor, the claimant*s  chroric mumbness on his
extremities would indeed impact his ability to perform even
sedentary work, given the need for fine motor skills and hand
dexterity that many jobs require, such as data entry, typing, or
assembly line work. The absence of sensation in his hands and
fingers would make it difficult for him to manipulate objects,
type accurately, or perform other tasks that require manual
dexterity.

Ald: Thank you, Mrs Kuhlman, for your experi testimony and
ingighttul analysis of the claimant's vocational profile. Your
thorough explanation has significantly aided in our understanding
of the claimant's employability and limitations. E'd like to take
this opportunity to summarize the hearing: we've heard from Dr.

Mayer regarding the claimant's chronic condition and its impact on

6955

Case ff3d-ce-2efab-1df Document 36-5 Filed 11/30/24 Page 76 of 156

his daily life; Mr. Kuhlman provided expert testimony on the
Glaimant's vocational profile, Highlighting the  signiticent
limitations placed on his ability to perform even sedentary work
due to his chronic pain, numbness, and fatigue; and we've had a
thorough discussion regarding the claimant's employability in
other occupations that may be available in the national economy.
Before I render my decision, is there anything else the claimant
would like to add or bring to my attention?

CLMT: Your Honor, I'd like to take a moment to express my
deepest gratitude to the vocational expert, Dr. Mayer, and the
entire panel for their tireless efforts in understanding my case.
Tt"s not just about numbers or statistics; it's about people,
their struggles, and their resilience. We're not just talking
about a claimant here; we're talking about a human being who's

believe the claimant meets the criteria for a finding of
